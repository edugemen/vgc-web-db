The substitute is removed once enough damage is inflicted on it, or if the user switches out or faints. Baton Pass can be used to transfer the substitute to an ally, and the substitute will keep its remaining HP. Until the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by other Pokemon and shields the user from status effects and stat stage changes caused by other Pokemon.

If the substitute breaks during a multi-hit attack, the user will take damage from any remaining hits.

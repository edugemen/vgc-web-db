If the target is a Flying type that has not used Roost this turn or a Pokemon with the Levitate Ability, it loses its immunity to Ground-type attacks and the Arena Trap Ability as long as it remains active. During the effect, Magnet Rise fails for the target and Telekinesis fails against the target.","shortDesc":"Removes the target's Ground immunity.","type":"Rock","num":479,"category":"Physical","priority":0,"accuracy":100,"pp":15,"basePower":50,"weightedUsage":2.466346414748914e-7},{"id":"supersonic","name":"Supersonic","desc":"Causes the target to become confused.","shortDesc":"Causes the target to become confused.","type":"Normal","num":48,"category":"Status","priority":0,"accuracy":55,"pp":20,"basePower":0,"weightedUsage":3.0186115710874436e-8},{"id":"whirlpool","name":"Whirlpool","desc":"Prevents the target from switching for four or five turns (seven turns if the user is holding Grip Claw).

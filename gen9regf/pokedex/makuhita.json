This move modifies the same 1/X chance of being successful used by other protection moves, where X starts at 1 and triples each time this move is successfully used, but does not use the chance to check for failure. X resets to 1 if this move fails, if the user's last move used is not Baneful Bunker, Burning Bulwark, Detect, Endure, King's Shield, Max Guard, Obstruct, Protect, Quick Guard, Silk Trap, Spiky Shield, or Wide Guard, or if it was one of those moves and the user's protection was broken. Fails if the user moves last this turn or if this move is already in effect for the user's side.","shortDesc":"Protects allies from multi-target moves this turn.","type":"Rock","num":469,"category":"Status","priority":3,"accuracy":true,"pp":10,"basePower":0},{"id":"zenheadbutt","name":"Zen Headbutt","desc":"Has a 20% chance to make the target flinch.","shortDesc":"20% chance to make the target flinch.","type":"Psychic","num":428,"category":"Physical","priority":0,"accuracy":90,"pp":15,"basePower":80}],"abilities":[{"name":"Thick Fat","id":"thickfat","desc":"If a Pokemon uses a Fire- or Ice-type attack against this Pokemon, that Pokemon's offensive stat is halved when calculating the damage to this Pokemon.","shortDesc":"Fire-/Ice-type moves against this Pokemon deal damage with a halved offensive stat.","num":47},{"name":"Guts","id":"guts","desc":"If this Pokemon has a non-volatile status condition, its Attack is multiplied by 1.5.
